# Automated-Options-Market-Maker

This repository extends my Options Market Maker Demo and runs it in an IBKR Paper Trading environment.
The base repo explains the core logic (CRR pricing, IV solver, inventoryâ€‘aware quoting, risk, hedging).

Here, the focus is on: 
- IBKR Paper Trading integration
- Weekly performance updates 
- Iteratively improving each component toward a more robust market-making system
